1. Introduction
For this football analysis project, I utilized Jupyter Notebook and Excel 2021 to preprocess, clean, and transform a dataset from the English Premier League. The dataset included details like team performance, match results, goals, and shots, among other statistics. My primary objective was to prepare this data for machine learning applications by reshaping it into a format conducive for predictive modeling.

2. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Data: Upon loading the raw dataset into pandas, I began by checking for any missing values. Key columns like "Div" (division) and "Time" (match time) had missing data, which I addressed by filling them with default values such as 'Unknown' for "Div" and '00.00' for "Time". This ensured consistency across the dataset.
Data Type Adjustments: I also converted certain columns, such as team names and referees, into categorical data types to improve memory usage and performance. Furthermore, I handled the "Date" column by converting it into a pandas datetime format to facilitate time-based operations.
3. Rolling Statistics Calculation
Team Statistics: I created custom functions to compute rolling statistics for teams, such as goals scored, goals conceded, and other relevant metrics, over the last 5, 15, and 38 matches. This transformation was essential for capturing trends in team performance over time, which would be valuable for future predictions.
Home and Away Aggregation: I ensured that statistics for home and away games were calculated separately. For instance, home team goals and away team shots were aggregated independently, enabling a more granular analysis of team performance.
4. Feature Engineering
Match Outcome Indicators: I added columns to denote the outcome of each match for the home and away teams, including Home Win, Away Win, and so on. These new columns were derived from the "FTR" (Full Time Result) column, representing whether the home or away team won, lost, or drew the match.
Rolling Sum Features: For each team, I applied rolling sum calculations to various match-related statistics such as goals, shots, fouls, and cards. This approach helped generate informative features that could be used to predict future match results based on past performances.
5. Final Data Preparation
Combining Data: After generating the required rolling statistics for all teams, I merged the results into a single dataset. I ensured that any remaining missing values were filled with zeros for consistency, making the dataset ready for machine learning.
Data Export: Once the data was fully preprocessed and feature-rich, I exported the cleaned and aggregated dataset to a CSV file, which is now ready for use in predictive analysis and model training.
6. Tools Used
Jupyter Notebook: The majority of the data processing was carried out in Jupyter Notebook using Python and pandas, enabling me to carry out detailed data cleaning, feature engineering, and aggregation in a step-by-step manner.
Excel 2021: While Jupyter Notebook handled the heavy lifting, I also leveraged Excel 2021 for visual inspection and verification of the dataset at various stages. Excel was particularly useful for checking transformations and ensuring the consistency of the data before final export.
7. Conclusion
The main aim of this project was to preprocess and transform football match data into a structured format suitable for machine learning models. By cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, creating meaningful rolling statistics, and engineering useful features, I prepared the data for predictive analysis. The final output is a comprehensive dataset with all the necessary features for forecasting match outcomes, ready to be used in machine learning models.
